#### Midoku’s Story and Benefits

Keeping track of your reading progress can be a persistent challenge when delving into the world of books, especially in today’s digital age. This issue becomes even more pronounced with online books, manga, manhwa, and light novels, as they often receive sporadic updates, sometimes with significant gaps between new chapters. When you find yourself engrossed in multiple forms of literature simultaneously, it’s all too easy for your reading experiences to blur together, leaving you uncertain about what you’ve already perused.
